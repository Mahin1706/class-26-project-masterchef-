Step 1: Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Lightly grease the inside of a 9-inch (22.86-centimeter) spring form cake pan. You can make the cake even easier to remove by lining the inside with a 9-inch (22.86-centimeter) circle cut from parchment paper.
If you want to make a layered cake, double this recipe and make two 9-inch (22.86-centimeter) cakes.

Step 2: Mix together the sweetened condensed milk and the butter. Pour the condensed milk into a large mixing bowl, then add the butter. Mix the two together until they turn light and fluffy. You can do this with a whisk or an electric mixer.

Step 3: Sift together the dry ingredients in a separate bowl. Sift the flour into a separate bowl. Add the cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Whisk them together until the color is consistent.

Step 4: Fold the dry mixture into the wet mixture. Pour the flour mixture into the condensed milk mixture. Stir them together with a rubber spatula, scrapping the bottom and sides of the bowl often.

Step 5: Stir in the vinegar, vanilla extract, and milk. Start with about half the amount of milk you need, then add more as necessary. Keep stirring until the texture is sooth and drippy.

Step 6: Pour the batter into the cake pan. Use a rubber spatula to help scrape out any excess batter from the bowl and into the pan. Gently tap the sides of the pan to help release any air bubbles.

Step 7: Bake the cake in the center of the oven for 25 to 35 minutes. Check the cake for doneness after 25 minutes by poking a toothpick into the center. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is done. If the toothpick has crumbs on it, bake the cake longer; check it every 5 minutes or so.


Step 8: Allow the cake to cool before taking it out of the pan. Use a potholder or an oven mitt to take the cake out of the oven. Set the cake down onto a wire cooling rack, and let it cool for about 15 to 25 minutes. Once the cake has completely cooled, take it out of the pan.

Step 9: Frost the cake as desired. Vanilla buttercream, chocolate buttercream, or chocolate ganache are all great choices here. If you make a layered cake, frost the top of your first cake with an off-set cake decorating spatula. Set the second cake on top, then finish frosting the top and sides of the stacked cakes.
For a more flavorful cake, fill it with some raspberry jam instead.
For a fancier cake, coat the top with chocolate ganache, then let it drop down the sides like icicles.
